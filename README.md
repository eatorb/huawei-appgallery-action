## üîë Setting up Huawei AppGallery API Access

To use this action, you'll need to set up API credentials in Huawei AppGallery Connect:

1. Log in to [AppGallery Connect](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/console)
2. Go to "Users and permissions" > "API key"
3. Create a new API client with the following permissions:
    - App Management
    - Publishing API
4. Make note of the Client ID and Client Secret
5. Go to "My apps" and select your app to find the App ID

## üîê Repository Secrets

Add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

- `HUAWEI_CLIENT_ID`: Your AppGallery Connect API Client ID
- `HUAWEI_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your AppGallery Connect API Client Secret
- `HUAWEI_APP_ID`: Your AppGallery Connect App ID


## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **403 Forbidden error**: Verify that your Client ID and Client Secret are correct and have the proper permissions.
- **File upload failures**: Check that your APK file exists at the specified path and is a valid APK.
- **API errors**: Ensure your App ID is correct and belongs to your account.

### Debug Logging

For more verbose logging, enable debug logs in your GitHub Actions workflow:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Navigate to "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"
3. Create a new repository variable:
    - Name: `ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG`
    - Value: `true`
